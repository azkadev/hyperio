  print ("start");
  Final Hyperioazkadev = Hyperioazkadev ();

# Important

- If one day this program does not work, it needs to be remembered again I never made a Suspicous / Fake Malware / Code maybe because of time, it is important to understand the time this code is made and what version of the framework I use. Don't just accuse!, I can get out of control!
- The program that I make basically does not depend on many dependencies
- Because it doesn't depend on a lot of dependencies even though my code is not updated, it is possible
- All the programs that I made if I am in the official account I guarantee 100% safe no malware, no suspicious- is still confused why my code / no bis compile? It is better if you feel unhealthy check the doctor first, if you behave deviant, trans*ender, l*bt or other things, first medicine you are not my suspicious / malware program, I never do bad things like that, before you make other people go crazy / follow kaYou, you better medicine first. If you still want to keep learning my code, it seems impossible because I'm not a trans*ender, l*bt so maybe the program code will make it difficult for your brain
- If there are suspicious or different screenshots and readmes, believe me, I don't make malware, suspicious programs, maybe I'm lazy to update, you can make an issue to ask me to update / clarify
